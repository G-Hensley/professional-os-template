  "mission_statement": "Build the tools we wish existed—products where security, quality, and craftsmanship aren't compromised for speed or scale. Prove that independent builders can deliver software that respects users, solves real problems elegantly, and maintains professional standards without corporate bureaucracy or venture pressure.",
