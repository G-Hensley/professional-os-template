# Logs

Automated logs generated by GitHub Actions and scripts.

## Folders

- **context/** - Daily context snapshots
- **github-activity/** - GitHub activity summaries
- **skill-analysis/** - Skill analysis reports
- **weekly-summary/** - Weekly summary reports
- **project-status/** - Project status snapshots

## Notes

- Logs are generated automatically by workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Each folder contains JSON files with dated snapshots
- A `latest.json` symlink points to the most recent file
- These files are used by the dashboard and AI tools for context
