# Assessment Command

Use this command to generate a self-assessment using the guidelines in `.claude/commands/assessment.md`. The assessment should be saved in `assessments/` with a filename like `YYYY-MM-DD-assessment.md` (or `YYYY-MM-DD-{area}-assessment.md` when focused on a specific area).

## How to run
1. Review context files referenced in the prompt (skills, projects, business docs, job applications, ideas, etc.).
2. Follow the structure and guidelines in `.claude/commands/assessment.md`.
3. Save the output to the `assessments/` directory with the correct filename format.
