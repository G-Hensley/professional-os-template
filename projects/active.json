    "problem": "Developers juggling employment, side projects, content creation, and job searching constantly re-explain context to AI tools, manually track skills across platforms, and struggle to maintain consistency between LinkedIn, GitHub, resumes, and portfolios. Every new AI conversation starts from zero.",
    "solution": "A version-controlled knowledge base that serves as the single source of truth for professional identity. AI tools read structured data (skills, experience, projects) and generate tailored outputs automatically. GitHub Actions handle routine updates. The developer stops re-explaining themselves and starts leveraging their accumulated context.",
