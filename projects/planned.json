Developers spend entire afternoons on boilerplate configuration instead of writing code. By the time the repository is properly structured, momentum and excitement have already faded.",
    "solution": "Dev Genesis is a GitHub template repository that handles all project setup automatically. In under 30 minutes, it generates a fully-configured repository with AI planning prompts that create importable GitHub issues, pre-configured support for Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and Windsurf, automated security scanning, and professional workflows. Developers go from rough idea to organized, production-ready project structure instantly—then start coding immediately.",

The full platform features 15-20 specialized base agents (product management, architecture, security, frontend, backend, testing, DevOps, etc.), with users able to generate custom agents on-the-fly for specific project needs. A built-in agent marketplace allows users to share and monetize specialized agents they've created. Vibiom includes an intelligent task board that AI agents control autonomously while remaining transparent and interactive for human oversight, plus real-time dashboards showing test pass rates, development velocity, and project health metrics. Rather than replacing developers, Vibiom acts as an autonomous engineering team—handling implementation while developers focus on strategy, architecture decisions, and quality oversight. Solo developers gain the output of an entire engineering organization; small teams scale like enterprises.",

    "problem": "Solo developers and small teams want to build ambitious products but can't afford full engineering organizations. Existing AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) help write code faster, but they're single-agent assistants - you still do all the architecture, security review, testing, and coordination yourself. More autonomous tools like Devin and Replit handle simple tasks but fail at complex, production-grade development because they lack specialized expertise. No tool gives solo developers the coordinated capabilities of an entire engineering team - where a product manager breaks down requirements, a backend engineer implements, a security engineer reviews, and a QA engineer validates, all working together autonomously.",
    "solution": "Vibiom is an AI orchestrator that coordinates specialized agents to build production-grade software - and it's being built to eventually improve itself. Starting as a CLI tool with three agents (Product → Backend → Security), it proves that multi-agent coordination produces better code than single-agent systems. Each agent specializes in one domain, validates previous work, and hands off to the next agent through structured workflows. As the system matures and proves reliable, Vibiom will dogfood itself - using its own multi-agent coordination to add features, expand capabilities, and refine its orchestration. The endgame: an AI engineering team that grows its own capabilities, starting with secure REST APIs and eventually handling complete application development.",

Solo developers shouldn't choose between autocomplete tools that make them faster coders and autonomous agents that produce mediocre code. Our mission is to demonstrate that specialized AI agents, each expert in their domain and working through peer review, produce production-grade code that single-agent systems can't match. We're starting small - three agents building secure APIs - because the foundation must be excellent before we scale. By dogfooding Vibiom to build Vibiom, we'll create an AI engineering organization that improves itself, giving solo developers the coordinated expertise of an entire team without the cost or complexity of hiring one."
