The full platform features 15-20 specialized base agents (product management, architecture, security, frontend, backend, testing, DevOps, etc.), with users able to generate custom agents on-the-fly for specific project needs. A built-in agent marketplace allows users to share and monetize specialized agents they've created.",

    "problem": "Solo developers and small teams want to build ambitious products but can't afford full engineering organizations. Existing AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) help write code faster, but they're single-agent assistants—you still do all the architecture, security review, testing, and coordination yourself. More autonomous tools like Devin and Replit handle simple tasks but fail at complex, production-grade development because they lack specialized expertise. No tool gives solo developers the coordinated capabilities of an entire engineering team.",
    "solution": "Vibiom is an AI orchestrator that coordinates specialized agents to build production-grade software—and it's being built to eventually improve itself. Starting as a CLI tool with three agents (Product → Backend → Security), it proves that multi-agent coordination produces better code than single-agent systems. Each agent specializes in one domain, validates previous work, and hands off to the next agent through structured workflows. As the system matures and proves reliable, Vibiom will dogfood itself—using its own multi-agent coordination to add features, expand capabilities, and refine its orchestration.",
