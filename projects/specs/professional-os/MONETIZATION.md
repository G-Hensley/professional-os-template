# Monetization Strategy

## Pricing Philosophy

**Sell the framework, keep the edge.**

The repository structure, schemas, and basic automations are valuable enough to sell. The advanced job automation (our competitive advantage) stays private for now, becoming a future SaaS upsell.

## What We DON'T Sell (Future SaaS)

These stay private as our competitive moat:

- **Job application automation** (tracking, follow-up detection)
- **Interview prep auto-generation** (calendar trigger)
- **Application response monitoring** (email parsing)
- **Advanced analytics dashboards**

These become the SaaS offering: "$19/month for the automation layer"

- Tease product on LinkedIn/Twitter

### Launch (January 16-31, 2026)

- Create urgency: "Launch pricing ends January 31"

### Post-Launch (February+)

## Payment Infrastructure

### Platform Options
1. **Gumroad** - Easy setup, handles everything, 10% fee
2. **Lemon Squeezy** - Lower fees (5%), better for digital products
3. **Stripe + Custom** - Most control, most work

**Recommendation:** Start with Lemon Squeezy for simplicity and lower fees.

## Refund Policy

**30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.**

Risk is low (digital product, one-time cost). Building trust is more valuable than protecting against the rare refund.
