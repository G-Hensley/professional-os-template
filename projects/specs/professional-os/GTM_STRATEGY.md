## Messaging Framework

### Primary Message
"Stop re-explaining yourself to AI. Your professional identity, version-controlled."

### Supporting Messages
1. **For Job Seekers:** "Generate tailored resumes in 5 minutes, not 5 hours"
2. **For Builders:** "Your professional brand on autopilot"
3. **For AI Users:** "Make Claude/Copilot 10x more useful with full context"

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can build this myself" | "You could. But will you? And will you maintain it? This is ready now." |
| "It's just files and folders" | "Structure is the value. Plus automations, commands, and documentation." |
| "Too expensive" | "How many hours do you spend on resumes and context? $97 pays for itself in one job application." |
| "I don't use AI tools that much" | "You will. And when you do, your context will be ready." |
