## Anti-Personas (Who This Is NOT For)

### The Non-Technical User
This requires comfort with Git, GitHub, and JSON files. If someone can't clone a repo, this isn't for them.

### The Enterprise Employee
Someone at a big company with a stable job who doesn't need to market themselves or track personal projects. Low motivation to invest effort.

### The Student/Junior Developer
Not enough professional history to benefit from the system. Better served by simpler tools until they have context worth managing.

### The "I'll Do It Later" Type
This requires initial setup effort. People who want pure automation without customization will be disappointed.
