## One-Liner

**Your professional identity, version-controlled. Stop re-explaining yourself to AI.**

## The Pitch

Developers spend hours every week re-explaining their skills, experience, and context to AI tools. Every conversation starts from zero. Professional OS is a GitHub repository template that serves as your single source of truth—AI tools read your structured data and generate tailored resumes, content, and assessments automatically.
