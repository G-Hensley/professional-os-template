# Problem Statement

## The Core Pain

Developers managing careers, side projects, content, and job searches waste enormous time on repetitive context-switching and re-explanation.

## Specific Pain Points

### 1. AI Context Reset
Every new AI conversation starts from zero. Developers re-explain their tech stack, experience level, coding preferences, and project context dozens of times per week. The AI never "knows" them.

### 2. Platform Fragmentation
Professional identity is scattered across:
- LinkedIn (profile, posts, company pages)
- GitHub (profile README, repos, contributions)
- Resume (multiple versions for different roles)
- Portfolio site
- Job applications
- Content calendars

Changes in one place don't propagate to others. Keeping them in sync is manual and error-prone.

### 3. Skill Tracking Decay
Skills learned months ago fade from memory. There's no systematic way to track what you know, what you're learning, or what's getting rusty. When it's time to update a resume, developers struggle to remember what they've accomplished.

### 4. Content Consistency
Developers building in public need to maintain consistent messaging across platforms. Without a single source of truth, voice and positioning drift over time.

### 5. Job Search Friction
Every application requires:
- Tailoring a resume to the job description
- Remembering which version you sent where
- Tracking application status manually
- Preparing for interviews with scattered notes

## Who Feels This Pain Most

1. **Senior developers** with complex professional identities (multiple skills, side projects, speaking, writing)
2. **Developers in active job search** who need to generate tailored materials quickly
3. **Solo founders** building multiple products while maintaining a personal brand
4. **Freelancers** juggling multiple clients and needing professional organization
5. **AI power users** who use Claude, Copilot, Cursor daily and want them to be smarter

## The Cost of the Problem

- **Time**: Hours per week re-explaining context, manually syncing platforms
- **Opportunities**: Missed because resume wasn't tailored, profile wasn't updated
- **Consistency**: Professional brand erodes through drift and fragmentation
- **Leverage**: AI tools operate at fraction of potential without full context
