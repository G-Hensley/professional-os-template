## Indirect Competitors

### Obsidian / Roam / Logseq
Personal knowledge management tools. Great for notes, but not structured for professional identity. No AI-native design, no automation.

One-time generation, not ongoing management. No structured data, just markdown output.

### Career Coaching / Resume Services
Human services, not tools. Expensive, not scalable, don't compound over time.

## Our Unfair Advantages

1. **We Built It For Ourselves First**
   This isn't a product looking for a problem. It's a working system we use daily.

2. **AI-Native From Day One**
   Not "AI features added later." Every design decision assumes AI will read this data.

3. **Developer-to-Developer**
   We understand the target audience because we ARE the target audience.

4. **Open Core Model**
   The template is inspectable. Users can see exactly what they're getting before buying.

5. **Compound Value**
   Unlike one-time tools, value increases the longer you use it. Data accumulates, automations improve.
