# Solution

## The Core Insight

Your professional identity should be **version-controlled, structured, and AI-readable**. When AI tools can read your full context from structured files, they stop being generic assistants and become personalized collaborators.

## What We're Building

A **GitHub repository template** that serves as a developer's professional operating system:

### Single Source of Truth
One repository containing:
- Skills with proficiency levels (JSON)
- Work experience with metrics (JSON)
- Projects with status tracking (JSON)
- Business/side project documentation
- Content strategy and calendars
- Job search tracking

### AI-Native Design
Every file is structured for AI consumption:
- JSON schemas for structured data
- Markdown for documentation
- Clear naming conventions
- Context files (CLAUDE.md, CONTEXT.md) that orient AI tools instantly

### Automation Built-In
GitHub Actions that run automatically:
- Daily context snapshots
- Skill detection from code activity
- Project status monitoring
- Content draft generation
- Weekly summaries

### AI Commands
Pre-built slash commands for common tasks:
- `/generate-resume` - Tailored resume from job description
- `/generate-post` - LinkedIn content from activity
- `/prep-interview` - Interview prep from company research
- `/assessment` - Periodic self-assessment

## How It Works

1. **Fork the template** and customize with your data
2. **AI tools read** structured context automatically
3. **Automations run** in the background, keeping data fresh
4. **Generate outputs** (resumes, posts, prep docs) on demand
5. **Context compounds** over time instead of resetting

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional Approach | Professional OS |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Re-explain context every conversation | AI reads full context from files |
| Manual platform syncing | Single source, multiple outputs |
| Skill tracking in your head | Structured JSON with proficiency levels |
| Scattered job search notes | Centralized tracking with automation |
| Generic AI responses | Personalized outputs from your data |

## The Moat

We keep the advanced job automation (application tracking, interview prep, response monitoring) as a future SaaS upsell. The template provides tremendous value; the automation provides recurring revenue potential.
