# Automation Philosophy

**If it can be automated, it should be automated.** This repo uses GitHub Actions to handle routine tasks automatically.

## Human Actions (Cannot Be Automated)

- **LinkedIn metrics**: No API access; use browser extension or manual entry
- **Job applications**: Log when you apply (automation can't know when you apply)
- **PR review**: Automations create PRs; you review and merge
- **Content posting**: Drafts are generated; you edit and post

## Per Event (Manual Triggers)

- Update `/profile/experience.json` when changing jobs
- Update `/projects/` when starting/completing projects (or use `[SHIP]` in commit message)
- Update `/profile/education.json` when earning certifications
