| **Vibiom MVP** | TypeScript (expert), Node (adept) | Anthropic SDK, multi-agent patterns |
| **TemperedUI** | React (expert), Tailwind (expert), Security (expert) | Storybook (novice→adept) |
| **DevGauntlet** | Next.js (expert), Supabase (adept) | Multi-tenancy patterns |
| **MindTrace** | - | Vibiom builds, you review |
| **InstAPI** | - | Vibiom builds, you review |
| **ScopeCreep** | PostgreSQL (adept), RLS knowledge | Vibiom builds, you review |
| **OpenOrbit** | React (expert), Supabase (adept) | WebSockets (apprentice→adept) |

## Strengths to Leverage

Already expert-level (use these as foundations):
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React/Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- REST APIs
- OWASP Security
- UI/UX Principles
- Accessibility Standards
- Vercel deployment

## Priority Stack

```
Q1: Anthropic SDK + Multi-agent  → Vibiom MVP (critical gap)
Q1: Marketing basics             → Product launches (new skill)
Q2: Storybook                    → TemperedUI (novice→adept)
Q2: Multi-tenancy                → SaaS products
Q3: WebSockets                   → OpenOrbit (apprentice→adept)
Q3: Certs (optional)             → Career + TTL
```

## Learning Philosophy

- **Project-driven**: Learn what's needed for current builds
- **Just-in-time**: Learn when you need it, not ahead of time
- **Documentation-first**: Official docs > tutorials
- **Build to learn**: No passive consumption
- **Review Vibiom output**: Learn by reviewing AI-built code
- **Level up, don't start over**: Build on existing expert skills
