# Learning Roadmap

Learning is **project-driven** - skills are learned as needed for what you're building.

## Current Skill Gaps

Review your `skills.json` and identify gaps based on your projects:

| Skill | Current | Target | Needed For |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| Skill A | novice | adept | Project 1 |
| Skill B | none | apprentice | Project 2 |
| Skill C | apprentice | expert | Current role |

## Quarterly Learning Goals

### Q1: Current Focus

| Area | Topic | Current → Target | Needed For |
|------|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Core Stack** | Advanced patterns | adept → expert | Main project |
| **DevOps** | CI/CD pipelines | novice → adept | Automation |
| **Testing** | Integration tests | apprentice → adept | Quality |

### Q2: Expansion

| Area | Topic | Current → Target | Needed For |
|------|-------|------------------|------------|
| **New Framework** | Technology X | none → apprentice | New project |
| **Backend** | Database optimization | adept → expert | Performance |

### Q3+: Future

| Area | Topic | Current → Target | Needed For |
|------|-------|------------------|------------|

## Skills by Project

| Project | You Already Have | Need to Level Up |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Project 1** | React, TypeScript | State management |
| **Project 2** | Node.js, Express | Database patterns |
| **Project 3** | - | New technology |

## Strengths to Leverage

Already expert-level (use these as foundations):
- Your strongest skills
- Technologies you know well
- Patterns you've mastered

## Priority Stack

```
Q1: Priority skill → Project it enables
Q2: Next skill     → What it unlocks
Q3: Future skill   → Long-term goal
```

## Learning Philosophy

- **Project-driven**: Learn what's needed for current builds
- **Just-in-time**: Learn when you need it, not ahead of time
- **Documentation-first**: Official docs > tutorials
- **Build to learn**: No passive consumption
- **Level up, don't start over**: Build on existing skills
