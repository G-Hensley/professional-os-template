### 👤 Personal (Gavin) - Build in Public

```
This week was a grind, but progress is happening 💪

I made 7 commits across my projects, focusing on Dev Genesis and TemperedUI. 

In Dev Genesis, I tackled some tricky integration issues that were slowing us down. By prioritizing user feedback, I streamlined a couple of features to make the experience smoother. 

With TemperedUI, I refined components to enhance security out-of-the-box. It’s all about shipping beautiful, functional code that doesn’t compromise on safety. 🔒

### 🔐 TamperTantrum Labs - Technical How-Tos

```
Start your week strong with a security tip! 🔒

Today, let's dive into a crucial aspect of API security: threat modeling your REST API.

Begin by identifying the assets within your API. Consider user data, authentication tokens, and any sensitive endpoints. Next, brainstorm potential threats like data leaks, unauthorized access, or even denial of service attacks.

Once you've mapped out these threats, prioritize them based on their impact and likelihood. This insight will guide your security measures, ensuring you're focusing on the most pressing issues first. Remember, proactive security saves you time and resources down the line! ⚡

### 🔐 TamperTantrum Labs - AppSec Wins/Stories

```
Found a critical bug in our auth logic 🔍

This week, while working on TemperedUI, I stumbled upon a vulnerability in the authentication process. 

After thorough investigation, I discovered that improper validation allowed users to bypass certain security checks. This could have led to unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

The fix? We implemented stricter validation rules and added comprehensive logging to monitor unusual access patterns. This proactive approach not only secured our app but also enhanced our overall security posture. 

It's a reminder of the importance of continuous security reviews in software development.

Have you encountered any unexpected vulnerabilities in your projects?

### 🏢 Codaissance - Craftsmanship & Quality

```
We spent a week refining our architecture for an AI workflow 🤖.

In the fast-paced world of development, it's easy to prioritize speed over quality. However, our recent focus on a robust architecture for our AI-driven project has proven invaluable.

We opted for a microservices architecture that allows us to scale independently and manage complexities effectively. This decision not only enhances performance but also simplifies our testing approach, leading to more reliable outcomes.

Investing time in architecture today means fewer headaches tomorrow. It empowers our team to innovate while maintaining high standards of quality 🚀.

### 👤 Personal (Gavin) - Career Journey

```
This week marked a significant milestone for me 🎉

After months of hard work, I finally completed my degree while juggling a full-time job. The journey was anything but easy, but the lessons learned were invaluable.

Time management became my best friend. I had to prioritize tasks, focus on what truly mattered, and sometimes sacrifice leisure time. Those late-night study sessions were tough, but they taught me resilience.

Now, I’m more equipped than ever to tackle new challenges in my career. This accomplishment isn't just a piece of paper; it's a testament to perseverance and commitment. Remember, every step counts in your journey! 💪

What milestones are you celebrating this week?

### 🔐 TamperTantrum Labs - Startup/Dev Pain Points

```
Ever felt like security is a never-ending race? 🏃‍♂️

As developers, we juggle countless tasks. But when it comes to security, it often feels like we're always playing catch-up. 

While building our projects, it's easy to overlook potential vulnerabilities. Yet, integrating security from the start can save us from major headaches later on. 

That’s why we created TemperedUI, a set of beautiful components designed to protect by default. Now, you can focus on shipping secure apps without the extra burden of writing security code. 🔒 

Let's make security a seamless part of our development process.

How do you incorporate security in your workflow?
